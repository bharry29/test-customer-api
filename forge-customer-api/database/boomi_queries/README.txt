I'm including only the shipping data query from GP, since it is complex and wouldn't want to lose it if boomi goes away.
This is not used within the application but in Boomi.
Boomi is the Dell service we use for data integrations in the cloud department. 
Please note that there are queries for the standard Forge tables, but there's nothing complex about them --
they are simply straight table-copies from Forge to the API db. Therefore, I'm not going to track them in version control.
